    can prevent clicking on an update entry
  * Kernel Manager:
      * Add menu button to upper right, remove reboot button and move
        functionality there, add additional reboot options and an option to set
        the default kernel. The "Reboot to another kernel" option once again
        filters out the current kernel, for that is now a separate option.
        Note that the menu only shows up if you're using GRUB and have more
        than one kernel installed.
      * Fix reboot to kernel functionality for liquorix kernels
      * Requests to open Kernel Manager from Update Manager will be ignored if
        the stand-alone version of Kernel Manager is already running
      * Changing Kernel Manager related preferences in Update Manager while a
        stand-alone Kernel Manager is running will update Kernel Manager's
        preferences view as well (the inverse is not true).
        However, a refresh made necessary by the changes will only happen if
        Kernel Manager's preferences are showing or get shown afterwards.
      * Fix toggling the checkbox to allow installation of different kernel
        flavors having no effect on a running Kernel Manager
      * Remove the upgrade eol series checkbox from the stand-alone version's

  * Kernel Manager:
    * Rename from `Linux Kernels` to `Kernel Manager`
    * Remove Close button and further adjust sizing of some elements in the
      bottom row to reduce the overall window width
    * Kernel Manager is now also available as a stand-alone program from your
      menu, in addition to the usual access via Update Manager's Tools menu.
      Note that the command opens the integrated version of Kernel Manager if a
      running Update Manager is detected.
    * The Reboot to Another Kernel button no longer filters out the current
      kernel, so you can use it to reboot to the same kernel even when it is
      not configured as GRUB's default.
    * Fix missing error message when kernel installation/removal fails due to
      the package management system being locked
  * Set Update and Kernel Manager's names in gnome-shell's top bar

  * Update translations, remove invalid help files for Creek language
  * Update and amend all manual pages. Note that I have never yet touched the
    online help available from the GUI since I forked the app - maybe updating
    it could be a community effort.
  * Automation:
    * Prevent both automatic upgrades and automatic maintenance from
      running at the same time
    * If the package management system is locked by another process at the time
      the upgrade or maintenance service starts, both of them will now wait for
      the package management system to become available instead of exiting
  * Kernel window: Add button to installed kernels indicating whether they can
    be automatically removed or not. Clicking the button will toggle the state.
  * Preferences: The checkbox for refreshing Software Manager's cache is now
    disabled if mintinstall is not installed
  * Add "show", "hide", "exit", "restart", and "refresh" CLI commands
  * Fix kernel window getting stuck in refreshing state in certain situations
  * Fix end-of-life mainline kernel upgrade not getting offered anymore if the
    kernel was still on the kernel.org front page (the change in 1:5.9.0 was
    only intended for the kernel window, not update selection)
  * Fix history window search
  * Fix changelog retrieval sometimes associating the wrong changelog with a

mintupdate (1:5.9.0~gm10) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Update translations
  * Mainline kernel end-of-life series are now included in the kernel window
    while they remain listed on kernel.org's front page, which is usually for
    a few weeks until the next series gets released.
    The main reason for this change is that the release of the last version in
    a series coincides with declaring it end-of-life, which meant you could
    never actually install said last version of the series via the kernel
    window because it would not show any end-of-life series.
  * Changes to kernel meta package selection:
    - Only meta packages that share an origin with the current kernel are
      suggested
    - Meta package selection is now conservative: when a meta of a higher
      kernel series has to be suggested, then it will no longer suggest the
      meta with the highest available series and instead the meta with the
      lowest available series that is higher than the current kernel. For
      example, on bionic, if you have a 4.18 kernel installed but no meta, then
      previously the linux-generic-hwe-18.04-edge package for currently the 5.3
      series would be suggested, instead now the linux-generic-hwe-18.04 meta
      for currently the 5.0 series will be suggested.
  * Fix regular kernel upgrade suggestion when no meta package is found
  * Fix changelog window width in some desktop environments
  * debian/control: Drop mintsystem dependency, the required settings have been
    moved to mint-common

      begins
    * The option to warn if system snapshots are not set up was removed
    * Enabling automated system snapshots now requires Timeshift to be
      installed and set up, failing that an error message will be displayed.
      The same applies if Timeshift or its configuration are subsequently
      removed.
  * Fix snapshot failure detection, non-fatal errors will now be ignored
  * Mainline kernels: Release candiate series are no longer proposed as an
    upgrade even if you checked the option to include them. That option now
    only affects the contents of the kernel window. I realize this is
    functionality loss but after seeing some users on RC kernels without much
    reflection I am not comfortable anymore with offering this.
    You can, of course, still manually install a release candidate-series and
    will continue receiving updates for that.
  * Several changes for improved compatibility with non-Linux Mint platforms
  * Packaging: Remove mint-mirrors dependency (moved to mintsources), add
    Timeshift to recommends

    along with Update Manager's cache. This enabled by default (and was before)
    but you can disable it to only refresh Software Manager on demand and thus
    decrease the system load due to Update Manager's remote refreshes.

    all kernels of the same series at once and more than one was installed
  * Fix the popup when downloading/installing/removing updates and non-mainline
    kernels not using the user's theme
  * Add option to preferences to notify automatic update users about a failure
    to update or a requirement to reboot.
  * mintupdate-cli/automatic updates now create /run/reboot-required, where
    appropriate, allowing the main application to display a notification in
    those cases (this is separate from and potentially in addition to the

  * If the main window is minimized it is now considered hidden as far as the

  * Unnecessary feature of the day:
    The main window now also remembers its position and will try to restore it.
    Due to timing issues the position may not be saved when quitting while the
    window is open. Also restoring the position will fail on display servers

  * Starting another instance of Update Manager no longer kills the existing,
    instead it shows it. This prevents problems caused by killing the Update
    Manager process in the middle of an update and simply makes more sense.
  * Preferences > Automation now shows the last and next run times for enabled
    automation options
  * Add AppIndicator support for the tray icon. AppIndicator is supported by
    more desktop environments than the deprecated GtkStatusIcon that's in use
    by default. However, because AppIndicator is more limited in functionality
    (no left-click toggle, no tooltip) I made it optional for now, you can
    toggle it in Preferences.
  * The reboot required notification is now persistent across restarts of the
    application. The file /run/reboot-required gets created and can be used
    by other applications/scripts.
  * Fix system snapshot failure not getting detected with the latest version of
    Timeshift. Improve snapshot creation status messaging.
  * Kernel window: Now stays in front of the main window at all times and does
    not appear as a separate window in the panel anymore when both are showing.
    Because of that its visibility states are now largely linked to those of
    the main window. Bit of an experimental feature, wanting to preserve my
    panel real-estate.
  * Mainline kernel installer now stays in front of the main window and has its
    state linked but retains a separate panel entry
  * Mainline kernel installer now verifies the checksums of the downloaded
    files before installing them and fails if they do not match.
  * Kernel window: Release candidate mainline kernels have a changelog button
    as well now, showing the git commit log for lack of a real changelog
  * Kernels: Add support for Valve's experimental mfutex kernels
  * Non-Unicode locales: Work around a bug in python-apt that would break
    refreshing the list of updates in non-unicode environments with mainline
    kernels enabled. The app should be fully non-unicode compatible now,
    however relevant that may be. It will still spam a lot of unicode errors to

mintupdate (1:5.6.9~gm10) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Self-updates are somewhat annoying, that's why they get another facelift:
    - the changelog is now shown on the self-update screen itself so you no
      longer have to find it in the history window after the update
    - authentication is no longer required - self-updates are not optional so
      it doesn't matter who installs them as long as they get installed.
    - you can choose to have self-updates performed automatically without user
      interaction in Preferences or right on the self-update page. It'll still
      pop up the synaptic window so you know it is happening.
    - The self-update button label apparently confused some users into thinking
      the computer would restart, this has been clarified
  * The list of updates now remembers which column you sorted by and even
    without custom sorting the default sort column gets marked as such rather
    than make the list appear unsorted, which it never is
  * Desktop notifications can now be disabled in preferences
  * Kernel window: Kernels from the -proposed pocket now get marked as
    "(Pre-release)" to make it easier to identify them. The "Unsupported"
    status alone was reportedly not clear enough of an indication. This now
    matches the option in Software Sources allowing you to enable "Pre-release"
    updates.
  * Kernel window: Fix the initial help screen not showing
  * Kernel window now specifically identifies certain mainline kernel builds
    in the status column, namely daily, drm-tip, drm-next and drm-intel-next.
  * Fix offering updates for above special mainline builds to regular versioned
    mainline builds. There is no support for installing and updating said
    builds for now, and unless somebody specifically asks for it there probably
    never will be (except for maybe the daily builds, I haven't decided).
  * Preferences slightly re-styled, and auto-refresh options are now on a
    separate Refresh tab
  * mint-refresh-cache: Fix exception in case of apt errors
  * Fix localization, seems this got broken a good while ago and nobody noticed
  * Many code quality and maintenance updates and few minor performance

mintupdate (1:5.6.4+build2~gm10) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Kernel window: Add a "Reboot to another kernel" button which allows you to
    reboot to a specific (installed) kernel. This will fail in cases where you
    are not using GRUB at all (the button should not even show then) or not
    from the current operating system, or if GRUB cannot write to the
    environment block, such as when it is stored on an MDRAID or LVM device.
    Feedback about how this feature is working out for you is appreciated. The
    worst that can happen in case of a failure is that you will reboot to your
    current kernel.
  * Authentication for preferences changes (automation features) now uses the
    common authentication handler introduced in 5.6.2 as well to further reduce
    the potential amount of authentications required in using the application
  * Automated system snapshots: In case of an error add the last line of output
    again to the final "System snapshot failed" status message and to the log
    so it remains available for review if the user only looks at it later
  * Include kernel packages to the History of Updates listing. Technically
    those are no upgrades except for the meta package but since mainline
    kernels have no meta package and also the kernel window allows installation
    of other kernels it makes sense to include them in the listing as part of
    the history of changes the application made to the system

  * Rework the update and kernel authentication system, you now have to
    authenticate only once for "Update Manager" (no longer "Synaptic") and that
    covers all steps of the process including snapshot creation, regular update
    and mainline kernel installation.
    Note that the system-configured maximum authentication cache duration still
    applies (by default 5 minutes) and if the overall process takes longer than
    that then you may be asked to authenticate again after all. This could be
    worked around but I'm not sure it's worth the complexity it would add.
  * Tray icon: Clicking on the icon or selecting the "Show" menu item no longer
    shows the main window while the kernel window is open. Instead the kernel
    window gets brought to the foreground.
  * Tray icon: Never make the "Show" menu item insensitive
  * Automated snapshots: Add option to show a confirmation dialog before
    creating a snapshot
  * Improve the description for Ubuntu kernel updates, explaining how to roll
    back a kernel
  * Mainline kernel installation: Improve error message in case no files to
    download could be found, assume build failure even if not indicated on the

  * The items in the Tools menu now have keyboard shortcuts
  * Tray icon menu now has "Show" and "History of Updates" items
  * Make sure all windows get raised upon open so window managers do not
    sometimes open them in the background
  * Mainline kernel versions installed as updates (i.e. via the main window)
    can now automatically be removed in the same way as Ubuntu's kernels
    (does not apply to mainline kernel updates installed with previous versions

  * mint-refresh-cache now updates mintinstall's cache as well (used to be

  * Some performance improvements, including removal of most instances of
    unnecessarily spawning a shell
  * Changed some notification icons

  * Show a desktop notification when a reboot is required, software updates, a

    these types of kernels unattended)
  * Kernel window: "Bug report" links renamed "Bug Tracker" and "CVE Tracker"

  * Add mainline kernel downloads and installations do now show a status
    window. This is not the final version because there is still a duality
    with usage of synaptic for other operations, so you (still) may have to
    authenticate twice. I remain undecided how I want to implement a combined
    version (rewrite aptdaemon and use that, write a new API, or simply use
    apt-get/dpkg in an integrated terminal as now for the mainline kernels).

  * Drop the super broken code that replaced package descriptions with
    localized descriptions in a random available language for a semi-
    random package. This also fixes the bug where compressed repository files
    were not supported. Localized translations will now properly be displayed
    where available (same as apt would on the command line).
  * Fix short descriptions (in the update list) not being localized
  * Fix string decoding/unescaping issues for all descriptions
  * Fix refresh while minimized not retrieving localization data
  * Main window menu, toolbar and certain tray menu items will now selectively
    get disabled where they would interfere with another running operation or
    open window. The rest of the application remains accessible now.
  * Added option to hide longterm support mainline kernels because the large
    number of kernels in some of these series can slow the kernel window down
    and most users will only be interested in the latest "stable" or "mainline"
    series, anyway.
    The filter options have no impact on receiving updates for those kernels,
    you will receive them within the same series no matter

  * Mainline kernels no longer get filtered by minimum series and instead by
    support status, making older longterm support kernel series available
  * Fix and streamline origin name rewriting
  * Rewrite of auto-refresh scheduling:
    - initial refresh now also gets delayed, not skipped, while the application
      window is open
    - refresh schedules are now dynamic and get reloaded in regular intervals,
      allowing for changes to a refresh interval during the interval or while
      it is delayed
    - a manual refresh will reset the recurring schedule
    - system sleep and changes to system date/time are handled more reliably
